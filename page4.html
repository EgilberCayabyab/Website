Ragdoll cats are our affectionate companions, with their velvety fur, big blue eyes, and friendly demeanor, they make great pets for families and singletons alike. They are generally healthy, but like all cats, they are prone to certain genetic disorders. They are generally easy to groom, and their coat doesn't shed much.
