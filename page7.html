 Is a popular breed of domestic cat that was developed in the mid-20th century in the United States. It was bred to resemble the wild leopard cat of the Bengal Peninsula, resulting in a cat with a golden or silver coat with black spots and stripes. The breed is known for its athleticism, agility, and playfulness, as well as its loyalty and friendly nature. Bengal cats are medium to large in size, weighing between 8 to 18 pounds and reaching lengths of up to 36 inches. They are a relatively healthy breed with a lifespan of 12-16 years.
